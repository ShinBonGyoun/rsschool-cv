## **About Myself**

After studying for 4 years at the Khabarovsk University and after working for 5 years in the construction laboratory of road management, I realized that I had achieved achievements in this area and it was time to learn something new in 28 years.

Unfortunately, I do not have any experience in programming, but I am sure that my great desire and perseverance will help me become a Frontend developer
